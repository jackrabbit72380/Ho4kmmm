A Halo 3 Editing Kit Mod That Enables Dark mode in H3EK Sapien.

V1 - Troglodyte-8 would be default Font size 8.

V2 - Troglodyte-11 would have 3x font size increase.

Troglodyte features a dark grey static background, providing a dark mode without the need to modify system themes. This mod also adopts the Convection UI Xbox font.
For optimal results, ensure you enable High DPI Scaling Override (System Enhanced) in the properties tab. This will make the text crisper and easier to read.

installation - Place Troglidyte-**.exe in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\H3EK

# Koko
A Halo 3 Editing Kit Mod That enables xbox font convection ui in H3EK Guerilla.

V1 - Koko-8 would be default Font size 8.

V2 - Koko-11 would have 3x font size increase.

Choose your secondary weapon!

installation - Place Koko-**.exe in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\H3EK

I have compiled two new versions of Guerrilla, also known as KOKO, with font upgrades. The upgrades are as follows:

V1 Koko-8: Koko-8 uses the Convection UI font from Xbox, allowing you to see more tag information on the screen with a crisp, clean, ClearType font without a significant size change. This is a huge improvement over the original Guerrilla.

V2 Koko-11: Koko-11 is similar but features a 3x font size increase for even better readability.

The bad news is that Koko does not include a dark mode to change themes internally, like Troglodyte. However, the good news is that it's not needed, as we can now control themes through any Windows 11 night mode theme. To apply a night mode theme, you will need to use SecureUXTheme's ThemeTool.exe and a Windows 11 custom night theme. These themes are different from typical dark and light themes, and you may have difficulty finding them online. Although you can create them yourself, I have uploaded a small collection of themes and the SecureUXTheme ThemeTool.exe for you. Keep in mind that not all of them will enable night mode in Sapien. However, night themes are included in this collection: https://github.com/jackrabbit72380/Windows-11-themes.

As Before For optimal results, ensure you enable High DPI Scaling Override (System Enhanced) in the properties tab. This will make the text crisper and easier to read.

```## Heres a small tutorial to get the themes working

1. Download my version of theme tool & the collection of themes. put the themes in C:\Windows\Resources\Themes.

2. open up theme tool as admin and check rename default colors, Hook Login, & Hook System Settings. Dont check explorer sence this is updated alot and not part of your system. Next just click install.

3. Reboot your computer.

4. Now you can select custom themes in your system setttings menu in the themes section.

5. things to know. This only works on windows 11. You don't need to patch a theme unless its custom. Troglodyte & Koko are not needed to get the themes working. dont mess with the themes in your Themes - AppData folder this is managed buy windows

6. if you want to create or test themes out without applying them to your system there is a test mode you can use in the msstyleEditor.exe

7. If you create a new theme and want to add it to the collection send me a message!
