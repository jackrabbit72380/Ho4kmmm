A Halo 3 Editing Kit Mod That Enables Dark mode in H3EK Sapien.

V1 - Troglodyte-8 would be default Font size 8.

V2 - Troglodyte-11 would have 3x font size increase.

Choose your weapon!

Troglidite uses dark grey static in the background so you can have a dark mode with out the need to mess with any system themes.
this mod also changes the font to convection ui xbox font.

Be sure to enable HIGH DPI Scaling override \ system enhanced in your propertys tab for best results! This will make the Text  more crisp and easy to read.

installation - Place Troglidyte-**.exe in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\H3EK

# Koko
A Halo 3 Editing Kit Mod That enables xbox font convection ui in H3EK Guerilla.

V1 - Koko-8 would be default Font size 8.

V2 - Koko-11 would have 3x font size increase.

Choose your secondary weapon!

installation - Place Koko-**.exe in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\H3EK

Koko I have compiled 2 new versions of guerilla aka KOKO with only font upgrades. The upgrades are 1. Koko-8. Koko-8 use convection ui from xbox so you can see more of your tag information on screen with crisp clean clear type font with no real size change! This is huge improvement over the original guerilla. 2.Koko-11  Koko 11 is the same but with a 3x font increase for even better readability.

bad news is koko does not contain dark mode to change your theme internaly like Troglidiyte but the good news is that its not even needed now sense we can now control themes through any windows 11 night mode theme.
To get a night mode themes you will need to use SecureUXTheme ThemeTool.exe & A Windows 11 Custom Night Theme. These themes are diffrent that your typical dark & light theme's
however you may have a hard time finding some online. & Allthoug you can make them your self.
i have uploaded a small collection of themes & the SecureUXTheme ThemeTool.exe for you keep in mind not all of them will enable night mode in sapien.
But there are night themes included with this collection. https://github.com/jackrabbit72380/Windows-11-themes

As Before Be sure to enable HIGH DPI Scaling override \ system enhanced in your propertys tab to have a clear type font.

## Heres a small tutorial to get the themes working

1. Download my version of theme tool & the collection of themes. put the themes in C:\Windows\Resources\Themes.

2. open up theme tool as admin and check rename default colors, Hook Login, & Hook System Settings. Dont check explorer sence this is updated alot and not part of your system. Next just click install.

3. Reboot your computer.

4. Now you can select custom themes in your system setttings menu in the themes section.

5. things to know. You don't need to patch a theme unless its custom. and Troglodyte & Koko are not needed to get the themes working.
