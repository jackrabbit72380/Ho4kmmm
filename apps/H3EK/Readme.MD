A Halo 3 Editing Kit Mod That Enables Dark mode in H3EK Sapien.

Troglodyte features a dark grey static background, providing a dark mode without the need to modify system themes. This mod also adopts the Convection UI Xbox font.
For optimal results, ensure you enable High DPI Scaling Override (System Enhanced) in the properties tab. This will make the text crisper and easier to read.

installation - Place Troglidyte-**.exe in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\H3EK

A Halo 3 Editing Kit Mod That enables xbox font convection ui in H3EK Guerilla.

V2 - Koko-11 would have 3x font size increase.

installation - Place Koko-**.exe in C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\H3EK

I have compiled two new versions of Guerrilla, also known as KOKO, with font upgrades. The upgrades are as follows:

V1 Koko-8: Koko-8 uses the Convection UI font from Xbox, allowing you to see more tag information on the screen with a crisp, clean, ClearType font without a significant size change. This is a huge improvement over the original Guerrilla.

V2 Koko-11: Koko-11 is similar but features a 3x font size increase for even better readability.

As Before For optimal results, ensure you enable High DPI Scaling Override (System Enhanced) in the properties tab. This will make the text crisper and easier to read.

Koko does not include a darkmode to change themes internally, like Troglodyte. However, it's not needed, as we can now control themes through any Windows 11 custom night mode theme. 

To apply a custom night mode theme, you will need to use SecureUXTheme's ThemeTool.exe and a Windows 11 custom night theme.

These themes are different from typical dark & light themes, and you may have difficulty finding them online. Although you can create them yourself, I have uploaded a small collection of compatable custom themes and the SecureUXTheme ThemeTool.exe for you.

Keep in mind that not all of them will enable night mode in Sapien. However, night themes are included in this collection Link here. : https://github.com/jackrabbit72380/Windows-11-themes.

## Heres a Tutorial to get custom themes working in Windows 11 That are compatable with the Mcc Editing Kits.

1. Download my version of theme tool & the collection of themes.  Link^ put the themes in C:\Windows\Resources\Themes.

2. Right Click on theme tool and open as admin then check Rename Default colors, Hook Login, & Hook System Settings. Dont check explorer. Next Click install. Then Reboot!

4. Now you can select custom themes in your system setttings menu in the themes section.

5. things to know. This only works on windows 11. You don't need to patch a theme unless its custom. Troglodyte & Koko are not needed to get the themes working. dont mess with the themes in your Themes - AppData folder this is managed buy windows

6. if you want to create or test themes out without applying them to your system there is a test mode you can use in the msstyleEditor.exe

7. If you create a new theme and want to add it to the collection send me a message!
