(Ho4kmmm) Halo Online 4k Main Menu Mod

This mod is currently only for the Halo 3 Campaign ported version of Halo Online Eldewrito Version 0.6.1.0. The 0.1.7 Version of The mod is still in development as I only have so much free time to dedicate to this project. I will be working to complete the project and bring it up to date for the latest version of Halo Online. 0.1.7 bare with me.
Until then, you can follow the step-by-step tutorial to do individual modifications to your main menu, but your results may vary as the game has evolved and been updated since the project began around the time of the 0.5 release.
FYI This script is made to work with Tag Tool [1.5.7136.891]. For adding block elements, you will have to use an older Tag Tool.
Please make sure your dewrito_prefs.cfg has UI Scaling turned off "Graphics.UIScaling 0" to use this mod.
4k 4096x2160 or 3840x2160 only!
Things are a little messy right now and some flags are off. You have been warned.
Please bear with me as I develop this mod.

Installation: Port the Halo 3 campaign using NoShotz's script, then install the mod using The Guardians Tagtool.
"00.install_campaign_&_theater_options.txt" is only for unported Halo Online Eldewrito Version 0.6.1.0.
I just uploaded a tutorial legend so you can fix anything. It lists all the 4k mod settings, just not in script format. It's what I'm using to create the script. ho4kmmm is the result of much time & Reserch. develpment is curently work in progress & currently in testing! any updates or completed status will be posted here,

0.1.7 was halted due to complication at the end of development TBH i only needed a little bit more code to finnish it but i got stuck. and have yet to find a fix. i will still try to finnish it one day. But because the advancments have been made for some time and left unfinnished I have desided that for now i have to relese much of the mods & poring scripts for the project for use with making .pak files. for ther users mods. How to use this you might ask? Download the Tags folder to your ElDewrito Directory. Find a mod you want to apply to your .pak file. Open the script and change the name of the .pak file to your's. make sure the directory for your .dds files is correctly refrencing the .dds image that it's for. then run the scipt. and it will install the mod to your .pak file.
