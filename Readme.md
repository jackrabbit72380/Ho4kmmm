(Ho4kmmm) Halo Online 4k Main Menu Mod

This mod is currently only for the Halo 3 Campaign ported version of Halo Online Eldewrito Version 0.6.1.0. The 0.1.7 Version of The mod is still in development as I only have so much free time to dedicate to this project. I will be working to complete the project and bring it up to date for the latest version of Halo Online. 0.1.7 bare with me.
Until then, you can follow the step-by-step tutorial to do individual modifications to your main menu, but your results may vary as the game has evolved and been updated since the project began around the time of the 0.5 release.
FYI This script is made to work with Tag Tool [1.5.7136.891]. For adding block elements, you will have to use an older Tag Tool.
Please make sure your dewrito_prefs.cfg has UI Scaling turned off "Graphics.UIScaling 0" to use this mod.
4k 4096x2160 or 3840x2160 only!
Things are a little messy right now and some flags are off. You have been warned.
Please bear with me as I develop this mod.

Installation: Port the Halo 3 campaign using NoShotz's script, then install the mod using The Guardians Tagtool.
"00.install_campaign_&_theater_options.txt" is only for unported Halo Online Eldewrito Version 0.6.1.0.
I just uploaded a tutorial legend so you can fix anything. It lists all the 4k mod settings, just not in script format. It's what I'm using to create the script. ho4kmmm is the result of much time & Reserch. develpment is curently work in progress & currently in testing! any updates or completed status will be posted here,

0.1.7 was halted due to complication at the end of development TBH i only needed a little bit more code to finish it but i got stuck. and have yet to find a fix. i will still try to finish it one day. But because the advancements have been made for some time & left unfinnished I have desided that for now i have to release much of the mods & poring scripts for the project for use with making .pak files. for other users mods.

How to use this you might ask? Download the Tags folder to your ElDewrito Directory. Find a mod you want to apply to your .pak file. Open the script and change the name of the .pak file to your's. make sure the directory for your .dds files is correctly referencing the .dds image that it's for. Then run the script. and it will install the mod to your .pak file. Please note that the porting scripts work differently they make new .pak files. and require maps.

also Please note that the 4k_mmm ...main menu mod is still being worked on and improved upon. More mod scripts and bitmaps can be added. This tags directory is being built with my own personal mod projects folder. Once downloaded you can start to make your own versions as needed and just use or make new scripts as needed. buy referencing mine.

Question.. Where's the Skulls?
Answer..
it is verry easy to replace the bitmaps with your own and rerun the mod scripts for adding a truly custom user interface for your own mods. Enjoy! one question i keep getting is where are the skulls at so here's the answer. there are 3 sets to choose from at the moment Default, Pixel flare, and H2anv. the bitmaps are in ElDewrito\tags\4k_bitmaps\ui\halox\campaign and the CEF menu sculls are in the 4k_menu_skins. & then the scripts to install them are in the 4k_mmm folder.  make sure to check the description.txt and that your installing the correct scripts for your version of halo.
