how to fix custom lobby title bitmaps

 in the ui\halox\pregame_lobby\pregame_lobby_campaign.gui_screen_widget_definition

my script somehow override the skulls shadow with the title and my bitmap. in the old version of eldweto the sculls where not there.
last time my datablock was like 2 this time it needs to be like 16 or 17 because all the mini sculls are in this block now.
the block i added was actuly blank so i moved the title data to block 17 and replaced the 2 block with the lobbyskulls data that was supposed to be there.
