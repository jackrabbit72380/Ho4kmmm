Hceek boulders for H3ek.

Installation
bounders folder go's in. tags/levels/test/icefields/scenery/bounders
if the directory does not exist you must create it.
then add them in to your scenario in sapien. under scenery.
now you can populate those empty looking maps and build all kids of stuff with boulders.

These 5 icefields boulders where ported from HCEEK to The H3EK. I then made 8 variants of the sets of 5 for different map environments and then exported for H3ek.
The textures I used where from Halo CE Anniversary. but you will probably want to add your own to Mach your map.
the shaders can be easily tweaked to get your desired map theme simply buy replacing one bitmap and editing the shader.
environments included are...

boulder_clif
boulder_crouch
boulder_grayrock
boulder_ground
boulder_snow
boulder_stone
boulder_swamp
boulder_tanrock

40 scenery tags total.
