First Download the tags folder to your ElDewrito directory.

Each 4k_mmm directory contains a set of scripts to run for different version's of Halo Online Eldewrito 0.7.1.

Next You need to determine what version of Halo Online Eldewrito 0.7.1 you want to use & then run the scripts set that you need in order!

To use the scripts set's you must first have a mod to apply them to.

For example if you want to have the halo 3 version of Halo Online Eldewrito 0.7.1. with all mainmenu & campaign maps ported.-with 4k menu textures & mod scaling enabled

First you would create a mod useing my porting scripts. from the main directory. "0.7.1-Port Halo3 Campain.txt" for example.

then you would apply the scripts from H3ho4kmmm4k-S in order to the mod.pak you created.

It is possible to apply scripts to your own mods as well. mix and match or even apply more mods on top of these mods. like adding skins or changing logo's for example.

however some knowlage of how to use tool and scripting for eldewrito modding is required.

I would not call this tutorial beginer friendly! there wont be anyone to help you if you run the scripts out of order and break your mod.
