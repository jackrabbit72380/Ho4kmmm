## 🔵 Q&A 

Qustion: Do you have to port huge chunks of content & entire campaigns to use this mod?

Answer: No! You simply need to know what version of Halo Online ElDewrito 0.7.1 Yor mod is useing & run the proper 4k_mmm script set. or custom script set for what you want to mod.

I recomend starting with ho4kmmm. You can just install the scripts that you want to your pak file. but some scripts need to be installed before others.

for example. For lobby titles. oviously you would need to install the block elemets first. before you could install the lobby titles. Then you could install the lobby titles. or

if you where working on a h1 mod you might want to use the lobby_titles_h1 in the 4k_lobby_titles directory for a custom version of that part of the menu.

so you could just run that script. & then mix & match the scripts that you want in your mod. 

if you install scripts from the same catagory with the same number they are just going to override eachother. 

so if you instaled a mod you did'nt like you could just override it with anohter of the same type without haveing your mod break or having to start over.

people keep asking me to just relese mod paks. but they dont seem to get the point. 

my own personal mod packs are still under contruction. but I put this together for other people to use in there own mod's for anyone who just wants to mod without porting anyhting.

I have prepared some vanilla mod packs made with the porting scripts that you can practice Modding with until you feal confidant enough to make your own mod.pak's 

but i do recomned you make your own wich is the whole point! media fire Links here.

Keep in mind These are just default ports no scripts have been applied! 

These mod's are a part of The Ho4kmmm Mod witch is a mod currently in development. This mod aims to upscale the main menu natively, add upscaled texture mods and other customizations to the Halo online user interface.

They serve as a starting point for Modder's to learn how to mod the main menu. 

Now you can mod with ho4kmmm and or add extra flair with main menu mods from these folders one per category!

4k_difficulty_style

4k_fronts

4k_lobby_style

4k_lobby_titles

4k_menu_skins (🚧 under construction)

Mix and match or layer additional mods (e.g., custom skins or logos) to personalize your mods main menu!

Pro Tip 😇: Enable High DPI Scaling Override (System Enhanced) in your ElDewrito executable’s properties for crisp 4K visuals!
