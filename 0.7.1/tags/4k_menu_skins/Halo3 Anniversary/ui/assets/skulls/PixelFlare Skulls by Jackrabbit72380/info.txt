Hi I made some new Skulls for halo online
original concept artist was pixel flare.
first time i saw them i wanted to try and get them in game ever since.
it's taken a lot of work but finally got around to it...
these sculls can be used in mods and maps and freely given out with exception . enjoy!
to just give the original artist pixel flare and the developer my self jackrabbit72380 some credit 

Installation:
go to Eldewrito\ui\assets\skulls make a backup
drop them in there over ride originals
