## to do.

fix lighting

add peli's

fix gametypes

add a bunch of other shi+

Notes!

The hanger needs teleporter setup and weapon ammo placement and some other cool stuff to make it fun its kind of bare bones.

anyone feal like setting it up in sapien ? i'm kind of swamped with other projects. it was fully lit but now has lighting issues. i can add more to it after sapien setup. if need be,

I'm working on a force field for the bay door might add it to the outside of the ship.

but haven't decided witch ship yet. might make the sky space but then that depends. the sky changes the color of the metal depending on the cube map used.

so i plan to go darker & then work ok the lights more. Right now its lit with skylight but it will look way different with the darker metal & lights working..
